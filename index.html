        <p>Hi, I’m Alisha! I graduated with a BS in Biology, but my true passion lies in the world of software development. I’m currently on an exciting journey to become a skilled software developer, and I’m loving every moment of it.</p>
        <p>I am becoming familiar with programming languages such as JavaScript and Python, which have opened up new avenues for me to build creative projects and develop dynamic, user-friendly web applications. My background in biology has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, which I now apply to coding challenges.</p>
        <p>The world of technology fascinates me, and I am driven by a strong desire to learn and grow as a developer. I am constantly exploring new tools and techniques to enhance my abilities and stay updated with the latest trends in the industry.</p>
        <p>I’m enthusiastic about collaborating on innovative projects and connecting with others who share my passion for tech. Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to work together or just have a chat about technology!</p>
